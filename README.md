# stock-analysis

## Overview of project
The purpose of this project was to refactor code in order to come up with the same results of a stock analysis file for Steve. Throughout the modual, we learned how to actually build the file with analysis with one code, and we refactored that code for this assignment.
## The data and analysis
The data in this file was given to us in csv format initially. We learned how to utilize the VBA function in excel to then analyze this data on a new tab. We were given two years of data: 2017 and 2018, and our analysis provided information on those years. We learned how to change the data through code to pull the data from a particular year, which we selected from a prompted text box. We also learned how to implement a button into our data file to run the analysis.
## The results
The results of our data provided us with the total daily return (total volume) and the return rate for 12 ticker symbols. We were able to see this information for both the 2017 and 2018 year. Below are images of our results.
