# stock-analysis

## Overview of project
The purpose of this project was to refactor code in order to come up with the same results of a stock analysis file for Steve. Throughout the modual, we learned how to actually build the analysis file with one code, and we refactored that code for this assignment. We learned how to use buttons, text prompt boxes, and conditional formatting during this exercise. It was a great learning experience and will definitely be applicable for my current and future job! 
## The data and analysis
The data in this file was given to us in csv format initially. We learned how to utilize the VBA function in excel to then analyze this data on a new tab. We were given two years of data: 2017 and 2018, and our analysis provided information on those years. We learned how to change the data through code to pull the data from a particular year, which we selected from a prompted text box. We also learned how to implement a button into our data file to run the analysis.
## The results
The results of our data provided us with the total daily return (total volume) and the return rate for 12 ticker symbols. We were able to see this information for both the 2017 and 2018 year. Below are images of our results.

## Advantages and disadvantages of refactoring code
An advantage of refactoring code is that you have the ability to make it more user/reader-friendly. You can make the code more applicable to your team's business language and it will be easier to explain. Additionally, you can take the original code and add/take out parts that do not apply to what you're trying to achieve. A disadvantage is that you may not be that confident in the code because you did not write it from scratch. An advantage that we had with this VBA script is we went through the process of writing the first code in our module, so we had that familiarity. We still did not create the code through, so the disadvantage of us not being 100% confident in the code could still be applicable here. I've found that you can certainly learn a lot by reading, reviewing, and refactoring code and really enjoyed this assignment!
